## What is Rocket?
Rocket is a technology platform that aims to provide software-related solutions. Focusing on knowledge spread, Rocket serves as an environment where users can receive personalized assistance regarding everything related to the software field.
The general Rocket workflow consists of users creating help requests, to be later reviewed and attended by different developers of the platform.<br>
By establishing effective communication with users, the developers will work on developing a solution for the users' requests. Users will be able to see the solutions that the developers provided for them and choose to collaborate with the one who they consider the best, most suitable option.
In a few words, Rocket is a platform focused on software solution development and knowledge spread. From solving bugs in a piece of code to designing interfaces for an application, this is a space that looks to enrich the learning of software for users and the community.

## About the project
This is a personal project that initially had the purpose of helping me to improve my web development skills. I haven't finished developing all of the interfaces I designed for it, but I'm still looking forward to working on it in the future.<be>
<br>Feel free to contact me for any suggestions or feedback you would like to give me. I'll appreciate it a lot. :)
